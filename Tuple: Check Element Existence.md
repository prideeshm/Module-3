# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=eval(input())
b=bool('8' in a)
c=bool('n' not in a)
print(c)
print(b)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus,the Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple is created successfully.
